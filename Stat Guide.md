A Real Beginners Reading List To An Introduction To Statistics
================
Author: Dylan Armbruster

## Note to reader:
- This Reading List Started out as just a basic list of books that I found to be better than others on Amazon. Continuing my education in statistics though has brought me to including other helpful resources and a new perspective. There are two books that the causal reader should read, but for everyone else I would suggest finishing your calc series as soon as possible and pick up a more mathematically rigorous text book(See Mathematical Statistics Section). 
- If you plan to do a statistics bachelors, you will find that a lot of your classes are pretty similiar in content from the previous classes, only the mathematical background assumption is higher. Given this, it makes sense to prioritize math classes. The higher level books/classes ofer far more than what you'll get from lower division book/classes(with some exceptions).
- Consider delving into subjects such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Proof
  Writing, and Real Analysis to deepen your ability to read higher level stat/probability books.

## Recommended Path For The Casual Reader (Baby Freedman):
I found these two books by Freedman to do a much better job than other introductory statistics books at this level. For example, how to properly understand Standard Deviation or R^2. 
1.  [Statistics by David
    Freedman](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-4th-David-Freedman/dp/0393929728/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5NI68XVXP3ZK&keywords=statistics+david+freedman&qid=1650668759&sprefix=statistics+dav%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-1)

- Note: There are exercises with solutions in this text. The text is
  very motivating, as it includes real world examples and wisdom from
  experienced authors.

2.  [Mathematical Methods in Statistics a
    Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Statistics-Workbook-Freedman/dp/0393952231/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28N5YKRU6IFYE&keywords=statistics+a+workbook+david+freedman&qid=1652509001&sprefix=statstics+a+workbook+david+freedman%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1)

- Note: Supplement this text with Freedman’s workbook or work on it
  after you’ve finished the text above. It is a bit more challenging
  because it includes exercises where you will write computations for
  algebraic proofs(Don’t worry! You don’t need to know how to write
  proofs). This workbook will mainly cover mathematical concepts
  relevant to statistics. It includes numerous exercises and problems,
  with detailed solutions provided for each. The exercises are designed
  to help readers develop their problem-solving skills and improve their
  understanding of mathematical concepts, as well as to reinforce the
  material covered in “Statistics”. Overall, this workbook is a valuable
  resource for anyone seeking to gain a deeper understanding of
  mathematical methods in statistics. Solutions to the odd number
  questions are included.
## Reading List For Other Topics With Regards To Statistics:

### Planning Experiments(Sadly seems to be going away):

- [Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery, 2nd
  Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Experimenters-Design-Innovation-Discovery/dp/0471718130/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3YHELNIIR4ZZ&keywords=george+box&qid=1650666248&s=books&sprefix=george+box%2Cstripbooks%2C129&sr=1-7)
  - The math pre-recs are pretty low. Comparable to the Freedman book

### Programming:
#### R Programming

- [The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software
  Design](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=r+programming&qid=1678071699&sprefix=R+Pr%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-8)

#### Python
- Note: It might be a good idea to prioritize python over R because [of](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668252/rstudio-changes-name-to-posit-expands-focus-to-include-python-and-vs-code.html)
- [Murach's Python Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-Python-Programming-Michael-Urban/dp/1890774979)
- [Murach's Python for Data Analysis]([https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-Python-Programming-Michael-Urban/dp/1890774979](https://www.amazon.com/Murachs-Python-Analysis-Scott-McCoy/dp/1943872767/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_2/147-6290256-4438431?pd_rd_w=TRNaY&content-id=amzn1.sym.1ad2066f-97d2-4731-9356-36b3edf1ae04&pf_rd_p=1ad2066f-97d2-4731-9356-36b3edf1ae04&pf_rd_r=DDTYWNAZ0TH70A7BTV01&pd_rd_wg=VEFN5&pd_rd_r=308b20b5-52a4-4444-ac47-79062d8c3fb6&pd_rd_i=1943872767&psc=1))

### Bayesian Statistics:

- [Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and
  Probability with Star Wars, LEGO, and Rubber
  Ducks](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Statistics-Fun-Will-Kurt/dp/1593279566/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35PDB8VSHAJLB&keywords=Bayes+the+fun+way&qid=1650668302&s=books&sprefix=bayes+the+fun+way%2Cstripbooks%2C141&sr=1-1)
  - Very little math background. I’ve found a few erros in the book, but
    I enjoyed the text anyway.
- [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and
  STAN](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/036713991X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CJK517HZVSXW&keywords=statistical+rethinking&qid=1652661627&sprefix=statistical+rethinkin%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-1)
  - The author claims you don’t need to know R, but I would recommend
    learning some of the basics in R. You could read this after the
    first Freedman book. The book is very motivating IMO!)

### Probability:

- [An Introduction to Probability and Inductive
  Logic](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Inductive-Logic/dp/0521775019/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FTWQME26MYFL&keywords=introduction+to+probability+ian+hacking&qid=1650669212&sprefix=introduction+to+probabilty+ian+hacking%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-1)
  - Very approachable and fun! Hacking is a fantastic author. I highly
    recommend checking out his other books.
- [Introduction to Probability, Second Edition from
  Blitzstein](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science-dp-1138369918/dp/1138369918/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)

  - [There is a solution manual for
    this](https://www.amazon.com/Student-Solution-Mathematical-Statistics-Application/dp/0495385069/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LNOGWWOZXX6S&keywords=mathematical+statistics+wacklery+solutions&qid=1678072249&sprefix=mathematical+statistics+wacklery+solution%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-5)
  - This book doesn’t assume you know anything about statistics or
    probability. But it does assume they know calculus. I recommend
    trying out the book until you get stuck.
