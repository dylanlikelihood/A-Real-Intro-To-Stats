A Real Beginners Reading List To An Introduction To Statistics
================
Author: Dylan Armbruster

## Note to reader:

- This reading list provides a structured introduction to statistics,
  designed with a minimal mathematical prerequisite. Upon completion, it
  is recommended to further bolster your mathematical foundation.
  Consider delving into subjects such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Proof
  Writing, and Real Analysis to deepen your statistical knowledge.

## Recommended Path:

1.  [Statistics by David
    Freedman](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-4th-David-Freedman/dp/0393929728/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5NI68XVXP3ZK&keywords=statistics+david+freedman&qid=1650668759&sprefix=statistics+dav%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-1)

- Note: There are exercises with solutions in this text. The text is
  very motivating, as it includes real world examples and wisdom from
  experienced authors.

2.  [Mathematical Methods in Statistics a
    Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Statistics-Workbook-Freedman/dp/0393952231/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28N5YKRU6IFYE&keywords=statistics+a+workbook+david+freedman&qid=1652509001&sprefix=statstics+a+workbook+david+freedman%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1)

- Note: Supplement this text with Freedman’s workbook or work on it
  after you’ve finished the text above. It is a bit more challenging
  because it includes exercises where you will write computations for
  algebraic proofs(Don’t worry! You don’t need to know how to write
  proofs). This workbook will mainly cover mathematical concepts
  relevant to statistics. It includes numerous exercises and problems,
  with detailed solutions provided for each. The exercises are designed
  to help readers develop their problem-solving skills and improve their
  understanding of mathematical concepts, as well as to reinforce the
  material covered in “Statistics”. Overall, this workbook is a valuable
  resource for anyone seeking to gain a deeper understanding of
  mathematical methods in statistics. Solutions to the odd number
  questions are included.
## Reading List:
### Planning Experiments:

- [Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovation, and Discovery, 2nd
  Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Experimenters-Design-Innovation-Discovery/dp/0471718130/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3YHELNIIR4ZZ&keywords=george+box&qid=1650666248&s=books&sprefix=george+box%2Cstripbooks%2C129&sr=1-7)
  - The math pre-recs are pretty low. Comparable to the Freedman book

### R Programming:

- [The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software
  Design](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=r+programming&qid=1678071699&sprefix=R+Pr%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-8)

### Bayesian Statistics:

- [Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and
  Probability with Star Wars, LEGO, and Rubber
  Ducks](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Statistics-Fun-Will-Kurt/dp/1593279566/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35PDB8VSHAJLB&keywords=Bayes+the+fun+way&qid=1650668302&s=books&sprefix=bayes+the+fun+way%2Cstripbooks%2C141&sr=1-1)
  - Very little math background. I’ve found a few erros in the book, but
    I enjoyed the text anyway.
- [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and
  STAN](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/036713991X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CJK517HZVSXW&keywords=statistical+rethinking&qid=1652661627&sprefix=statistical+rethinkin%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-1)
  - The author claims you don’t need to know R, but I would recommend
    learning some of the basics in R. You could read this after the
    first Freedman book. The book is very motivating IMO!)

### Probability:

- [An Introduction to Probability and Inductive
  Logic](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Inductive-Logic/dp/0521775019/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FTWQME26MYFL&keywords=introduction+to+probability+ian+hacking&qid=1650669212&sprefix=introduction+to+probabilty+ian+hacking%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-1)
  - Very approachable and fun! Hacking is a fantastic author. I highly
    recommend checking out his other books.
- [Introduction to Probability, Second Edition from
  Blitzstein](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science-dp-1138369918/dp/1138369918/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
  - [Lecture

  - <https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home>

### Mathematical Statistics:

- [Mathematical Methods in Statistics a
  Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Statistics-Workbook-Freedman/dp/0393952231/ref=sr_1_1)
  - You will be exposed to proofs in this. If you find yourself
    struggiling with those, I recommend this [How to Prove It: A
    Structured
    Approach](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Daniel-Velleman/dp/1108439535/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FL6Y1PU2EKQ2&keywords=how+to+prove+it&qid=1660402387&sprefix=how+to+prove+it%2Caps%2C175&sr=8-1)
- [Statistical Thinking from Scratch: A Primer for
  Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Thinking-Scratch-Primer-Scientists/dp/0198827636/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1Z8XXEQN46AU9&keywords=Statistical+Thinking&qid=1669095171&sprefix=statistical+thinkin%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-5&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.08f69ac3-fd3d-4b88-bca2-8997e41410bb)
  - This one includes a primer on the math that will be used within the
    book. The author gudies you through the book using R.
- [Mathematical Statistics with Applications, 7th
  Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Applications-Dennis-Wackerly/dp/0495110817/ref=sr_1_7?crid=SN6G9FPMBBMP&keywords=mathematical+statistics+wacklery&qid=1678070894&sprefix=mathematical+statsistics+wacklery%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-7)
  - [There is a solution manual for
    this](https://www.amazon.com/Student-Solution-Mathematical-Statistics-Application/dp/0495385069/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LNOGWWOZXX6S&keywords=mathematical+statistics+wacklery+solutions&qid=1678072249&sprefix=mathematical+statistics+wacklery+solution%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-5)
  - This book doesn’t assume you know anything about statistics or
    probability. But it does assume they know calculus. I recommend
    trying out the book until you get stuck.

### Applied Linear Regression:

- [Applied Linear Regression
  Models](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Linear-Regression-Models-Michael/dp/0072386916/ref=sr_1_2?crid=JDFSBZ159MH2&keywords=Applied+Linear+Regression&qid=1678685083&sprefix=applied+linear+regression%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-2)

- [Data Methods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/)
  - This is a place where statisticians, epidemiologists,
    informaticists, machine learning practitioners, and other research
    methodologists communicate with themselves and with clinical,
    translational, and health services researchers to discuss issues
    related to data: research methods, quantitative methods, study
    design, measurement, statistical analysis, interpretation of data
    and statistical results, clinical trials, journal articles,
    statistical graphics, causal inference, medical decision making, and
    more.
